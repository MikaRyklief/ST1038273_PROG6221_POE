COMPILING AND RUNNING THE PROJECT

Open the Project Solution:

If you already have the project solution opened, skip to the next step.
If not, navigate to File -> Open -> Project/Solution..., then browse to the folder containing your project files and select the solution file (.sln) to open.

Build the Solution:

In Visual Studio's menu, go to Build -> Build Solution to compile the project.
Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + Shift + B as a shortcut.

Set Startup Project (if needed):

If your solution contains multiple projects, set the startup project by right-clicking on the desired project in Solution Explorer and selecting Set as StartUp Project.

Run the Program:

Press F5 or go to Debug -> Start Debugging to run the program in debug mode.
Press Ctrl + F5 or go to Debug -> Start Without Debugging to run the program without debugging.

View Output:

The output of your program will be displayed in the Output window or in a console window, depending on the type of application you've created.

DEBUGGING (OPTIONAL)

If you encounter any errors or unexpected behavior while running your program, you can use Visual Studio's debugging features to diagnose and fix issues:

Set breakpoints by clicking in the margin next to the line of code where you want to pause execution.
Step through code using the Debug toolbar or keyboard shortcuts (F10 for step over, F11 for step into).
Inspect variable values and call stack in the Locals and Watch windows.
Use the Error List window to view build errors and warnings.
