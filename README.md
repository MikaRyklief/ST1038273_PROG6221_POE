# ST1038273_POE_Recipe_Management_Application
This is my PROG6221 POE, It is a recipe application to help people to cook/bake new food.
It is a command-line application written in C# for managing recipes. It allows users to enter the details of a recipe, including ingredients and steps, and perform operations such as scaling quantities and resetting values.

COMPILING AND RUNNING THE PROJECT

Open Visual Studio: Launch Visual Studio from the Start menu or by double-clicking its shortcut icon on the desktop.

Open the Project Solution:

If you already have the project solution opened, skip to the next step.
If not, navigate to File -> Open -> Project/Solution..., then browse to the folder containing your project files and select the solution file (.sln) to open.

Build the Solution:

In Visual Studio's menu, go to Build -> Build Solution to compile the project.
Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + Shift + B as a shortcut.

Set Startup Project (if needed):

If your solution contains multiple projects, set the startup project by right-clicking on the desired project in Solution Explorer and selecting Set as StartUp Project.

Run the Program:

Press F5 or go to Debug -> Start Debugging to run the program in debug mode.
Press Ctrl + F5 or go to Debug -> Start Without Debugging to run the program without debugging.

View Output:

The output of your program will be displayed in the Output window or in a console window, depending on the type of application you've created.

DEBUGGING (OPTIONAL)

If you encounter any errors or unexpected behavior while running your program, you can use Visual Studio's debugging features to diagnose and fix issues:

Set breakpoints by clicking in the margin next to the line of code where you want to pause execution.
Step through code using the Debug toolbar or keyboard shortcuts (F10 for step over, F11 for step into).
Inspect variable values and call stack in the Locals and Watch windows.
Use the Error List window to view build errors and warnings.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I CHANGED:

I added all the functionalities that part2 has asked us to do such as adding unlimited recipes, naming recipes and more. Improvements I have made based on feedback are Improving error handling, I unfortunately was not able to change the colour of text and use advance error handling features. The scaling factor has drastically improved and now scales everything including the newly added feature (calories). I was unsuccessful when attempting to prompt the user to confirming to clear the data before the data was cleared but will try to sort this out in the following updates. I have increased readability of the entire project by including breaks and coments as well as a END OF FILE line at the very end of each class. I have split all the classes but have not split methods into different classes as I think this will create a messy project and it has a good structure that works. 

CONTRIBUTING:

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
